
===Project#1  Supervised Learning: Using different Regression Models for Energy prediction

Energy requirement for the milling process was predicted using three different models i.e. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Generator. 
Different errors were calculated and all models were compared. 

===Project#2  Image Classification: Using SVM and Deep learning( ANN, CNN) for detection of Faulty Electric drives

The target was to classify accurately the fully assembled electrical drives. Pictures of different sides of the drives were taken.
Models of Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks were applied. Both models were analyzed and compared. Data augmentation was performed.

â€‹**Google Collab environment was used and many Python libraries such as Scikitlearn, Keras, Tenser Flow were implemented in both projects. Further information is given in below links.
