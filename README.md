
===Project#1  Supervised Learning: Using different Regression Models for Energy prediction

Energy requirement for the milling process was predicted using three different models i.e. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Generator. 
Different errors were calculated and all models were compared. 

â€‹**Google Collab environment was used and many Python libraries such as Scikitlearn, Keras, Tenser Flow were implemented in both projects. Further information is given in below links.
